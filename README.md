# Crime Data Visualization

📊 **Project Overview**

Analyzing and visualizing crime data across U.S. states to identify trends and correlations in various types of crimes. The goal is to understand how different crime categories correlate with factors like population, state averages, and regional variations.

Tools used include Tableau,R 🖥️, with libraries like GGally, ggplot2, corrplot, reshape2, psych, and dplyr. The dataset focused on local crime data from 2012. The process involved cleaning and filtering the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, and violin plots. Correlation analysis was used to identify crime associations, and the data was broken down state-wise to analyze crime composition and deviations across regions.

**1. Crime Composition by State**

Explanation: This choroplot illustrates the distribution of different crime types (e.g., violent crime, property crime) across various states. It highlights which states have higher incidences and providing insights into regional crime profiles. This indicates potential areas for targeted policy interventions.

**2. Avergae Crime per Capita**
   
Explanation: This chart highlights states with the highest and lowest crime rates per capita. For example, in 2012, Arkansas had the highest crime rate at 638.5 per 100,000 residents, followed by Missouri and Aso on . Such insights can inform resource allocation and crime prevention strategiess

**3. Correlation Heatmap of Crime Types**

Explanation: The correlation matrix uncovers relationships between various crime types. For instance, a strong positive correlation between burglary and robbery suggests that states with high burglary rates also tend to have high larceny-theft rates. Understanding these relationships can aid in developing comprehensive crime reduction programs.

**Outcome**

The outcome resulted in interactive and insightful visualizations revealing trends like Crime Composition 🏙️, Population vs. Crime Rates 🌎, and State Comparisons ⚖️, providing actionable insights into crime patterns and state-level discrepancies.
