üìä **Project Overview: Crime Data Visualization**

Analyzing and visualizing crime data across U.S. states to identify trends and correlations in various types of crimes. The goal is to understand how different crime categories correlate with factors like population, state averages, and regional variations.

Tools used include Tableau,R üñ•Ô∏è, with libraries like GGally, ggplot2, corrplot, reshape2, psych, and dplyr. The dataset focused on local crime data from 2012. The process involved cleaning and filtering the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating visualizations such as heatmaps, bar charts, scatter plots, and violin plots. Correlation analysis was used to identify crime associations, and the data was broken down state-wise to analyze crime composition and deviations across regions.

**1. Crime Composition by State**

Explanation: This choroplot illustrates the distribution of different crime types (e.g., violent crime, property crime) across various states. It highlights which states have higher incidences of specific crime categories, providing insights into regional crime profiles.

2. Avergae Crime per Capita:

3. Correlation Heatmap of Crime Types

Explanation: The correlation plot displays the association between different crime types. Strong correlations (positive or negative) can indicate patterns, such as burglary and robbery crimes has highest postitive correlation.

Outcome:

The outcome resulted in interactive and insightful visualizations revealing trends like Crime Composition üèôÔ∏è, Population vs. Crime Rates üåé, and State Comparisons ‚öñÔ∏è, providing actionable insights into crime patterns and state-level discrepancies.
